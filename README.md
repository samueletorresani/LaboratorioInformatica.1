# Basic VSCode C++ Configuration

This repository can be used as template when creating a new repo here on GitHub. Students are encouraged to create personal private repositories where they will keep their exercises, tests and assignements.

By default it contains two example folders with sample code. New projects/exercises will be put into new folders. 

Compilation is performed in a per-folder basis: to compile one of the folders, open any of the C++ files and launch the task  `BUILD`. A binary file  `main.exe` will be put into the folder if the build is succesful. 

The task `BUILD and RUN` will compile and then run the program. This is the default build task and can be accessed with a default keyboard binding (CRTL+SHIFT+B on Windows).
